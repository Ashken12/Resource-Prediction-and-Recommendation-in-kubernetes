4. Edge-Binding-Mount: An Edge-Mount Relationship in Meshery represents the assignment of persistent storage to Pods via PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC).

6. Edge-Binding-Firewall: An Edge-Firewall Relationship in Meshery models a Kubernetes Network Policy that controls ingress and egress traffic between Pods.

7.  Edge-Non-Binding-Network: An Edge-Network Relationship in Meshery represents the networking configuration between Kubernetes components, typically illustrated by a dashed arrow connecting a Service to a Deployment.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include Luigi, Oozie and Azkaban.

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's XCom feature). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.

Principles
Dynamic: Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.
Extensible: Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.
Elegant: Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow using the powerful Jinja templating engine.
Scalable: Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers.","Topic 5: Policies, Kyverno, Modules","catalog, meshery-catalog, uncategorized, meshery.io, apache, (or, airflow",0,0.0.1,TRUE,meshery-catalog,https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/catalog,Apache-2.0,0,0,0,0,"Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

cloud-native-pizza-store,"The Pizza Store application simulates placing a Pizza Order that is going to be processed by different services. The application is composed by the Pizza Store Service which serve as the front end and backend to place the order. The order is sent to the Kitchen Service for preparation and once the order is ready to be delivered the Delivery Service takes the order to your door.
As any other application, these services will need to store and read data from a persistent store such as a Database and exchange messages if a more event-driven approach is needed.

This application uses PostgreSQL and Kafka, as they are well-known components among developers.
As you can see in the diagram, if we want to connect to PostgreSQL from the Pizza Store Service we need to add to our applications the PostgreSQL driver that must match with the PostgreSQL instance version that we have available. A Kafka client is required in all the services that are interested in publishing or consuming messages/events. Because you have Drivers and Clients that are sensitive to the available versions on the infrastructure components, the lifecycle of the application is now bound to the lifecycle of these components.

Adding Dapr to the picture not only breaks these dependencies, but also remove responsabilities from developers of choosing the right Driver/Client and how these need to be configured for the application to work correctly.

consul-on-kubernetes,"Consul is a tool for discovering, configuring, and managing services in distributed systems. It provides features like service discovery, health checking, key-value storage, and distributed coordination.

In Kubernetes, Consul can be useful in several ways:

1. Service Discovery: Kubernetes already has built-in service discovery through DNS and environment variables. However, Consul provides more advanced features such as service registration, DNS-based service discovery, and health checking. This can be particularly useful if you have services deployed both within and outside of Kubernetes, as Consul can provide a unified service discovery mechanism across your entire infrastructure.

2. Configuration Management: Consul includes a key-value store that can be used to store configuration data. This can be used to configure applications dynamically at runtime, allowing for more flexible and dynamic deployments.

3. Health Checking Consul can perform health checks on services to ensure they are functioning correctly. If a service fails its health check, Consul can automatically remove it from the pool of available instances, preventing traffic from being routed to it until it recovers.

4. Service Mesh: Consul can also be used as a service mesh in Kubernetes, providing features like traffic splitting, encryption, and observability. This can help you to manage communication between services within your Kubernetes cluster more effectively.

Overall, Consul can complement Kubernetes by providing additional features and capabilities for managing services in distributed systems.

It can help to simplify and streamline the management of complex microservices architectures, providing greater visibility, resilience, and flexibility. catalog, meshery-catalog, cluster, uncategorized, meshery.io, consul",0.3855207611,0.2220004676,0.03237598294,0.03074032595,0.3293624624

Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the Kubernetes API to determine a desired list of DNS records. Unlike KubeDNS, however, it's not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. AWS Route 53 or Google Cloud DNS.

In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way. synchronizes, catalog, meshery-catalog, exposed, cluster, uncategorized, meshery.io, externaldns",0.1699116612,0.6902215123,0.04668728687,0.04661774268,0.04656179696

The updated version, K8sAllowedReposv2, introduces support for exact match and glob-like syntax to enhance security: 1. Exact Match: By default, if the * character is not specified, the policy strictly checks for an exact match of the full registry, repository, and/or the image name. 2. Glob-like Syntax: Adding * at the end of a prefix allows prefix-based matching (e.g., registry.example.com/project/*). Only the * wildcard at the end of a string is supported. 3. Security Note: To avoid bypasses scenarios, ensure prefixes include a trailing / where appropriate (e.g., registry.example.com/project/*). enforces, policy, artifacthub, this, gatekeeper-policies, certificate management",0.03478456243,0.03452658558,0.034511244,0.0357253735,0.8604522345
